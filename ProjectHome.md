**SFUI module**

SFUI is an extension for SFML applications that enable creating Graphical User Interfaces.
It was designed for OOP developers, and can be greatly extended for your project's needs.

There are some tutorials on the wiki to start with the module.
SFUI also provides built-in styles for widgets, but it can be very easily modified.

The project is under development, so you can help it by issuing the tracker, or visit the [wiki](HomePage.md) for further documentation.
